# Tigger
Implementation and exercise solutions for Appel's Modern Compiler Implementation in C.

## Usage

There are a few helpful commands:
- `make lextest`: build executable `lextest`, which you can run with
  `./lextest example.tiger` to see the tokens that get lexed.
- `make parsetest`: build executable `parsetest`, which you can use
  to see if a program is properly parsed or not.
